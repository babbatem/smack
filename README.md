# Sensorized Manipulation Challenge Kit (SMaCK)
SMaCK is a benchmark for quantifying physical dexterity, exporation, and planning abilities in embodied agents. The benchmark consists of several sensorized puzzle boxes designed to test agents' ability to perceive and manipulate articulated parts. 

URDF and MuJoCo XML files can be found in `assets`. The directories with prefix `mj` denote the MuJoCo models.      
Assembly instructions are in `SMaCK Assembly Instructions.pdf`.    
The `Digital Resources.zip` file contains part source spreadsheet, CAD files and Arduino code. 
Gym environments forthcoming!
